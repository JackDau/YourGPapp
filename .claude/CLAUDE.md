# YourGP Patient App

## Project Overview

Native mobile patient app for YourGP general practice (ACT, Australia).

**Goal**: Beautiful, easy-to-use app for patients of all ages.

**Primary Tasks**: Appointment booking and video consultations.

**Technology**: React Native (iOS + Android)

## Design Direction

- **Feel**: Warm and personal - like being greeted by name at a friendly local practice
- **Inspiration**: Apple Health (clean, accessible) + One Medical (warm healthcare)
- **Aesthetic**: Premium but approachable, clinical but not cold

## Design Principles

1. **Warm, not clinical** - Avoid stark whites and cold blues. Use warm neutrals.
2. **Clear, not clever** - Every action should be obvious. No hidden gestures.
3. **Spacious, not sparse** - Generous padding shows care.
4. **Personal, not generic** - Use patient's name, their GP's photo, their history.
5. **Accessible by default** - Large touch targets (44pt+), clear contrast, readable text.
6. **Calm, not urgent** - Healthcare is stressful enough. The app should reduce anxiety.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| PATIENT_PORTAL_REVIEW.md | Current prototype analysis and gaps |

## Four-Pillar Context

This app is **Pillar 3 (Patient Experience)** but depends on:
- Pillar 1 (Team) - Staff tools for handling requests
- Pillar 2 (GP) - GP dashboard for approvals and video calls

Build patient-facing features only after staff/GP tools exist.

## Specialized Agents

For design work, invoke these via the Task tool:
- `art-director` - Aesthetic direction and visual strategy
- `design-system-architect` - Tokens, foundations, system architecture
- `component-designer` - Individual UI components
- `layout-architect` - Page structure and information architecture
- `animation-choreographer` - Motion and transitions
- `responsive-strategist` - Multi-device adaptation
- `voice-strategist` - UX writing and microcopy

## Success Criteria

- A 75-year-old can book an appointment without help
- A 25-year-old finds it as refined as their banking app
- GPs feel the app represents their premium practice well
- Patients say "This feels like YourGP knows me"
